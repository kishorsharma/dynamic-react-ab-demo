Following are some sample file which helps to understant module functionality:

* Each experiment can be used as a variation.
* We need to place code similar to sample in VWO/Optimizely.
* Then we can assign user traffic to each variation based on our requirment.

Their are plenty good tutorials for creating variation. Please check respective site for same.


With google tag manager:
* As it is always available for 100% user we can simply create a HTML tag.
* Copy code inside script tag and it will be available to all users.

AB Testin need custom logic. I am not aware of AB testing via gtag.

For GTM: 

* Create Workspace and paste gtm code in head section of your HTML file.
* Create a tag in your workspace of type HTML.
* create script block.
* Paste sample code in it.
* You can check it in preview mode and then publish it.

GTM is easy to try as it can be used with localhost.
